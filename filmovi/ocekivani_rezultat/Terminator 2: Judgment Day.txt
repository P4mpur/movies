A product of nearly a year of research and revision, the script tells the story of a boy and his cyborg protector entirely in lines and phrases taken from the plays of William Shakespeare. Each line and phrase is taken from original folios, with only proper nouns, pronouns and corresponding verb tenses subject to change. In doing so, the authors were able to accurately recreate the story of Terminator 2: Judgement Day, while remaining true to the words of Shakespeare in form, if less so in intent.</p><img src="https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500" ></img><h1>Original Title : Video Cop: Terminator Commando</h1><p>ID: 965618</p<p>Overview : Jake Crusher is a cop from the 80's who gets sucked into a VCR where he becomes Video Cop.</p><img src="https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/ge2YeTh5DpdxzS32u1eHPIGV36w.jpg" ></img><h1>Original Title : The Terminators</h1><p>ID: 26342</p<p>Overview : A small band of resistance fighters battle the cyborgs that have taken control of the planet.</p><img src="https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/7LV3sg3bJOGFD6J0gn7Wt1IL5SK.jpg" ></img><h1>Original Title : Terminal Sud</h1><p>ID: 592776</p<p>Overview : In a Mediterranean country plunging into armed conflict, a doctor tries to do his duty against all odds, until the day his destiny is turned upside down…</p><img src="https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/5b8jjy8FoXuGx5tbjwwpQwvICIN.jpg" ></img><h1>Original Title : Ninja Terminator</h1><p>ID: 40027</p<p>Overview : Three martial-arts students search for the Golden Ninja Warrior, a statue reputed to have magic powers.</p><img src="https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/5YkYpKxTQVq4gna3qTztwwwo8YF.jpg" ></img><h1>Original Title : The Making of 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day'</h1><p>ID: 473793</p<p>Overview : Documentary of the making of the sequel to the popular Schwarzenegger film, The Terminator.</p><img src="https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/m0k3vRqh4eVZONufDahNufHi8Em.jpg" ></img><h1>Original Title : 홍길동 대 터미네이터</h1><p>ID: 624026</p<p>Overview : When a book containing Hong Gil-dong's magic was stolen from the museum, a boy and his friend will see Hong Gil-dong and Terminator of the past.</p><img src="https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/iX1Z18HEz6eUug1SJyKWK2zZNyh.jpg" ></img><h1>Original Title : ターミネーター・斬KILL</h1><p>ID: 911529</p<p>Overview : In 2050, a nuclear war broke out all over the world.
