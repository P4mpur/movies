It is India’s duty to be loyal to this great truth, and never allow it to be extinguished by the storm of passion weeping over the present day world. That is why we must be careful today to try to find out the principle by means of which India will be able for certain to realise herself. That principle is neither commercialism nor nationalism, it is not nearly self determination, but self conquest and self dedication. The voice of this truth was heard in India’s forests of old above the din of race conflict.“</p><img src="https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500" ></img></div></html>
