Yet, the ground often gives way plastically, opening up a dense and paradoxical field for visual musings and delights as colours, solids and transparencies as well as spaces within spaces weave a tapestry of a somewhat familiar ‘city’.</p><img src="https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500" ></img><h1>Original Title : City</h1><p>ID: 657042</p<p>Overview : A sequence of shots from a fourteenth floor flat in the City of London, starting with a building shattered by the IRA, focusing on a crane and its driver, roadworks, a building site, passing seasons.

Wilson in 2018.</p><img src="https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/iCgnR5yzy7s3lJUztIpa67lu8oE.jpg" ></img><h1>Original Title : City</h1><p>ID: 850907</p<p>Overview : A crime thriller from brand new production house Dream Films.</p><img src="https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/cHZS8ujgtnnb6EEZHNjlvV70LRA.jpg" ></img><h1>Original Title : City</h1><p>ID: 315533</p<p>Overview : 1964, Autumn in Chicago. This was my 4th film, shot while waiting to go to prison for refusing to serve in the US military. Silent. B&W. I think it captures the sense of depression, of loneliness within the city. Looking back it seems almost archaic, Chicago as some kind of East Bloc country in Soviet times.</p><img src="https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500" ></img><h1>Original Title : Cidade de Deus</h1><p>ID: 598</p<p>Overview : In the slums of Rio, two kids' paths diverge as one struggles to become a photographer and the other a kingpin.</p><img src="https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/k7eYdWvhYQyRQoU2TB2A2Xu2TfD.jpg" ></img><h1>Original Title : City</h1><p>ID: 1200588</p<p>Overview :  </p><img src="https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500" ></img><h1>Original Title : GODZILLA 決戦機動増殖都市</h1><p>ID: 492719</p<p>Overview : Humanity's desperate battle to reclaim the Earth from Godzilla continues.
