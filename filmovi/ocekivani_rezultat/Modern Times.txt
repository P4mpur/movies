The film considers binary notions of stillness and dance, high and low culture, history and future, in order to better understand various iconographies.</p><img src="https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/mywdvGWxOTQENVuqI3KaaAbqasr.jpg" ></img><h1>Original Title : Modern</h1><p>ID: 386575</p<p>Overview : Short experimental animation by Mirai MIzue</p><img src="https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/vpJcbjUmcYTqdLmmHjO7U3idGnB.jpg" ></img><h1>Original Title : Bang Gang (une histoire d'amour moderne)</h1><p>ID: 327040</p<p>Overview : Biarritz.

After an unfortunate confrontation with a colleague, Andrés is disciplined and transferred to the Ministry of Equality. There everything is totally new to him: there are no assigned places, no schedules, and everyone is a vegan. Andres will have a lot of catching up to do to adapt to this new order of things.</p><img src="https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/kI2wF5PNWjAmh6uqpPxTt8PWOcq.jpg" ></img><h1>Original Title : 現代任侠道 兄弟分</h1><p>ID: 1014156</p<p>Overview : After the enactment of the Anti-Prostitution Law, the red-light district in Shinjuku lost its allure.

Focusing mainly on cities and provinces in Argentina, Germany, and Bolivia, Emigholz’s latest film is a work of quiet observation and historical excavation. From slaughterhouses in Salamone to the flooded former spa city of Epecuén to the newly built Humboldt Forum in Berlin, the film demonstrates the effect of capital on public spaces, where creation and destruction go hand in hand, and as always, Emigholz makes the journey one of intellectual force and cinematic beauty.</p><img src="https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/yOuvYODewHI48Cnwp3k7H4eKYhG.jpg" ></img><h1>Original Title : La luz, tríptico de la vida moderna</h1><p>ID: 396942</p<p>Overview : A three-part love story: Alborada, Cénit y Ocaso (Sunrise, Noon and Sunset).
