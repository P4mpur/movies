The frame rate is then decelerated to the standard 24fps for presentation. The film emphasizes each gesture, sway and flare of flame as the small pinewood carrier ignites across the landscape of the filmstrip and screen, signalling the drama and poetics of this ”minor” event before the fire is extinguished. One also stands as an unassuming beacon, immortalizing on film the essence of some of Ono’s early concerns as an artist. At the slightest touch of fire, they burst into flame. Strike everywhere. Strike often.</p><img src="https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500" ></img><h1>Original Title : The One Hundred</h1><p>ID: 949697</p<p>Overview : A quarantine hotel where overseas travellers stay in isolation to curb the spread of a contagious virus, but they soon become prey to a strange breed of a 100-legged monster.</p><img src="https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/o89snIeueVAH0m56vM15v0RjpEz.jpg" ></img><h1>Original Title : ONE PIECE “3D2Y” エースの死を越えて! ルフィ仲間との誓い</h1><p>ID: 290271</p<p>Overview : The special takes place during the two year before the Straw Hats reunite on Sabody.
