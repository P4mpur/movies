Unemployed, and with no family, he hopes to find a place to commit seppuku—and a worthy second to deliver the coup de grâce in his suicide ritual. The senior counselor for the Iyi clan questions the ronin’s resolve and integrity, suspecting Hanshirō of seeking charity rather than an honorable end. What follows is a pair of interlocking stories which lay bare the difference between honor and respect, and promises to examine the legendary foundations of the Samurai code.</p><img src="https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/5konZnIbcAxZjP616Cz5o9bKEfW.jpg" ></img><h1>Original Title : 一命</h1><p>ID: 85836</p<p>Overview : A tale of revenge, honor and disgrace, centering on a poverty-stricken samurai who discovers the fate of his ronin son-in-law, setting in motion a tense showdown of vengeance against the house of a feudal lord.</p><img src="https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/rqIqSoxbsVTfcr6CgTtSpzJBkYt.jpg" ></img><h1>Original Title : 女腹切り・散華</h1><p>ID: 390674</p<p>Overview : Part of the Zankoku-bi: Onna harakiri 01 series.</p><img src="https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/fvwrnUvdek6YhtTqomxCfU6M5sS.jpg" ></img><h1>Original Title : 女学生・腹切り</h1><p>ID: 398766</p<p>Overview : A school girl kneels on her mat looking over an old photo album containing pictures of people committing seppuku.

She stops at the top of the stairs to say her prayers, rings a bell, and heads inside where the footage is shot in color. She unravels her kimono and rubs her face with the cloth before wrapping her blade and lovingly touching it. She pulls it across her stomach and slits herself open, falling to the mat. She crawls across the mat, dying, slipping in her own slick blood until she can't move anymore.</p><img src="https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/kFIO2l5cfvNj1xsJymmOCUE5caQ.jpg" ></img><h1>Original Title : 女腹切り・聖餐</h1><p>ID: 311676</p<p>Overview : A woman in a nurse’s outfit sits in a dark room.

Incompetence leads him to the constant contemplation of a suicide and anticipation of a post-mortem fame. However, the apartment he’s settled in is not suitable for meeting one’s end because of the lack of hot water. It doesn’t bother the tenants since they’re too afraid of a mysthical ‘Babay’ (Boogeyman) allegedly killing everyone who dares to fix it.
